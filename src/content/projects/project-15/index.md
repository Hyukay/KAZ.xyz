# Resilient Microservices Architecture for Transit Comparison

A robust, fault-tolerant microservices system designed to compare transit routes across multiple providers, with built-in resilience against failures.

## Architecture Overview

This system demonstrates advanced microservices principles in action, featuring:

- **Service Isolation**: Each component operates independently to prevent cascading failures
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks ensure system stability
- **Event-Based Communication**: MassTransit handles inter-service messaging
- **Comprehensive Telemetry**: Detailed monitoring across all system components
- **Chaos Testing**: ChaosMonkey integration to validate fault tolerance

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core**: Backend framework powering the microservices
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **MassTransit**: Message bus for reliable inter-service communication
- **STM & TomTom APIs**: Data providers for transit information
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request monitoring

### Resilience Strategies

The architecture was specifically designed to handle failure scenarios:

1. **Network Partitions**: Services continue operating with degraded functionality when isolated
2. **API Outages**: Fallback mechanisms provide alternative data sources
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Graceful degradation under load
4. **Service Restarts**: State recovery and request replay mechanisms

## Documentation & Process

Documentation was a key focus of this project, including:

- Comprehensive architecture diagrams
- Failure scenario analysis and mitigations
- Clear team task allocation with traceability
- Performance and reliability metrics

This project demonstrates how to build truly resilient systems that maintain functionality even under adverse conditions.
