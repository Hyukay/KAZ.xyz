# Topic-based Publish/Subscribe Messaging System

A robust, distributed messaging platform built from the ground up that enables efficient communication between applications via a publish/subscribe pattern with advanced topic routing capabilities.

## System Architecture

This project implements a complete messaging system with the following components:

- **Message Broker**: Central hub managing topic subscriptions and message routing
- **Publisher Client**: Applications that send messages to specific topics
- **Subscriber Client**: Applications that receive messages from topics they've subscribed to
- **Topic Registry**: Hierarchical topic management with wildcard support
- **Message Store**: Persistent storage for messages with configurable retention

## Technical Features

### Core Functionality

- **Wildcard Topic Routing**: Support for `*` (single-level) and `#` (multi-level) wildcards
- **Message Filtering**: Server-side filtering based on message properties
- **Format Conversion**: Automatic translation between XML, JSON, and custom formats
- **Quality of Service**: Configurable delivery guarantees (at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once)
- **Persistent Subscriptions**: Durable subscriptions surviving client disconnection

### Implementation Details

- **Pure Java Implementation**: Built from scratch without messaging frameworks
- **Socket Communication**: Direct TCP/IP communication for core functionality
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: Optional bridge to industry-standard message broker
- **Multithreaded Architecture**: Concurrent message processing for high throughput
- **Stream Processing**: Efficient handling of message streams

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed for high performance in distributed environments:

- Optimized thread pool for message processing
- Batched message delivery for efficiency
- Minimal object creation in hot paths
- Efficient topic matching algorithms
- Backpressure handling for slow consumers

## Use Cases

This messaging system is suitable for various distributed application scenarios:

- Event-driven architectures
- Microservices communication
- IoT device messaging
- Real-time data processing
- System monitoring and logging

The implementation demonstrates deep understanding of messaging patterns, multithreaded programming, and network communication principles.
