# Hnefatafl AI Game Bot

An advanced artificial intelligence system for playing the ancient Viking board game Hnefatafl, implementing sophisticated game tree search algorithms optimized for strategic gameplay.

## About Hnefatafl

Hnefatafl ("nef-ah-tah-fel") is a family of ancient Nordic and Celtic board games played on a 13×13 grid. Unlike chess, it's an asymmetric game where one player controls a king piece and defenders trying to escape, while the other player controls attackers trying to capture the king.

## Technical Implementation

### Core AI Algorithms

- **Minimax Search**: Evaluates potential moves by exploring the game tree
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes search by eliminating irrelevant branches
- **Custom Heuristics**: Domain-specific evaluation functions that understand Hnefatafl strategy
- **Move Ordering**: Prioritizes promising moves to maximize pruning efficiency

### Performance Optimizations

- **Transposition Tables**: Caches previously evaluated positions to avoid redundant computation
- **Iterative Deepening**: Progressively increases search depth while maintaining responsive play
- **Bitboard Representation**: Uses bitwise operations for ultra-fast board state manipulation
- **Opening Book**: Pre-computed optimal moves for early game situations

## Tournament Performance

The AI competed in a performance-based tournament against other Hnefatafl bots, demonstrating its effectiveness through:

- Strong tactical awareness in capturing opponent pieces
- Strategic understanding of king movement and escape routes
- Efficient time management during complex decision points
- Adaptation to different opponent playing styles

## Technical Challenges

Developing an effective AI for Hnefatafl presents unique challenges compared to other board games:

- Asymmetric gameplay requires different strategies for each side
- Large 13×13 board creates a vast search space
- Unusual movement rules increase complexity
- Lack of existing research compared to chess or Go

The implementation successfully addresses these challenges through careful algorithm design and game-specific optimizations.
