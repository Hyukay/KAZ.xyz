# AIGC Detection Model

A sophisticated machine learning system designed to identify AI-generated images with high accuracy, built on Vision Transformer architecture and trained on a large dataset of authentic and synthetic images.

## Project Overview

As AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly realistic, the ability to distinguish between human-created and AI-generated content grows more critical. This project addresses this challenge through:

- Vision Transformer (ViT-16) architecture for visual pattern recognition
- Extensive training on 50,000+ diverse images
- Robust evaluation methodology
- Practical applications for content moderation and verification

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture

- **Vision Transformer**: ViT-16 backbone optimized for image classification tasks
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained weights fine-tuned for AIGC detection
- **Custom Classification Head**: Specialized final layers for binary classification
- **Attention Visualization**: Heat maps showing regions of interest in detection

### Data Engineering

- **Diverse Dataset**: 50,000+ images spanning multiple AI generators and authentic sources
- **Data Augmentation**: Random crops, flips, rotations, and color adjustments to improve robustness
- **Balanced Training**: Equal representation of AI-generated and authentic images
- **Cross-validation**: K-fold validation ensuring reliable performance metrics

### Optimization Techniques

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search to identify optimal learning rate, batch size, and model configuration
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Float16/32 training for faster processing
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Effective training with limited GPU resources
- **Early Stopping**: Prevention of overfitting while maximizing accuracy

## Competition Results
