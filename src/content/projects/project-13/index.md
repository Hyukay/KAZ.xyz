# Secure Web Application

A comprehensive web application demonstrating enterprise-grade security practices, featuring role-based access control, advanced authentication, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Salted Password Hashing**: Securely stores user credentials using modern cryptographic techniques
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions system controlling resource access
- **Session Management**: Secure creation, storage, and expiration of user sessions
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Optional additional security layer for sensitive operations
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Protection Against OWASP Top 10

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-forgery tokens for all state-changing operations
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of recommended HTTP security headers
- **Secure Dependency Management**: Regular automated vulnerability scanning

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC with a focus on security-first design:

- **Identity Framework**: Extended with custom security enhancements
- **Policy-based Authorization**: Dynamic permission evaluation based on user roles
- **Data Protection API**: Secure data storage and transmission
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive security event auditing
- **Admin Configuration Panel**: Custom security policies manageable through UI

## Administrator Features

The security administration dashboard allows authorized users to:

- Configure password complexity requirements
- Manage user roles and permissions
- Review security logs and detect anomalies
- Set session timeout policies
- Configure multi-factor authentication requirements

## Development Practices

This project follows security best practices throughout the development lifecycle:

- Threat modeling during design phase
- Regular security code reviews
- Automated security testing
- Pen-testing before deployment
- Documentation of security features and configurations

This application demonstrates how to implement comprehensive security features while maintaining usability and performance.
