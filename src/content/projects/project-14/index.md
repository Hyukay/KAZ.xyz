# Financial News Sentiment Analyzer

A sophisticated natural language processing system that analyzes sentiment in financial news, social media, and market reports to predict cryptocurrency price movements with high accuracy.

## System Architecture

The analyzer consists of several integrated components:

- **Data Collection Engine**: Gathers financial news, social media posts, and market reports
- **NLP Processing Pipeline**: Analyzes text for sentiment, relevance, and market impact
- **Time Series Model**: Correlates sentiment trends with price movements
- **Prediction Engine**: Forecasts potential market movements based on sentiment analysis
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Displays sentiment trends and predictions

## Technical Implementation

### NLP Technologies

- **BERT Model**: Fine-tuned for financial text analysis with domain-specific vocabulary
- **Sentiment Classification**: Advanced sentiment detection beyond simple positive/negative categorization
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies companies, cryptocurrencies, and financial events
- **Topic Modeling**: Categorizes news into relevant market sectors and themes
- **Contextual Analysis**: Understands nuanced market implications in financial reporting

### Data Collection

- **Multi-source Integration**: Processes data from news APIs, Twitter, Reddit, and financial forums
- **Real-time Streaming**: Continuous ingestion of new content
- **Historical Archives**: Backfilling of historical data for model training
- **Source Credibility Scoring**: Weights information based on reliability of sources
- **Structured and Unstructured Data**: Processes both formal news and informal social discussions

### Time Series Analysis
