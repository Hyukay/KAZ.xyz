# zkAds: Privacy-First Advertising Platform

A revolutionary advertising platform that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs to protect user privacy while still enabling targeted advertising.

## Key Features

- **Privacy Preservation**: User data never leaves their device
- **Targeted Advertising**: Advertisers can target users without accessing their personal information
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic verification without revealing underlying data
- **Rust-Powered**: High-performance backend with Rust ensuring security and speed

## Technical Implementation

zkAds leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to create a new paradigm for online advertising. The platform ensures that users' personal data remains completely private while still allowing advertisers to target relevant audiences.

### How It Works

1. User preferences and data are processed locally on the device
2. Zero-knowledge proofs verify that a user matches advertiser criteria without revealing the actual data
3. The matching process happens without any sensitive information being transmitted
4. Advertisers receive verification that their ads will reach relevant audiences without accessing personal data

## Impact

This project addresses the growing concern around data privacy in digital advertising. By providing a technical solution that doesn't compromise on targeting capabilities, zkAds demonstrates that privacy and effective advertising can coexist.

The implementation in Rust ensures the platform is secure, efficient, and can handle complex cryptographic operations with optimal performance.
